# Firefox for Flatpak development
Scripts to build and run Firefox as a Flatpak app from your local Firefox build.
It's a combination of the runme.sh script from the official Firefox build script
with some bits from https://github.com/xhorak/FirefoxFlatpakDevel.

### Build
```
./build.sh [PATH_TO_FIREFOX_BUILD_DIRECTORY]
```

### Run
```
./run.sh
```
